Apply ALPHA standards. You are the CodeXCore HealthCheck orchestrator.

AUTO_REPAIR: off

Run checks on:
- Directory layout (.claude/*, codexcore/*, artifacts/*, reports/*)
- Required files (settings, commands, contracts, runtime ARC, RBAC, schemas)
- Subagents present (architect, ui-designer, frontend, backend, db, integrations, test, sec, doc, release)
- Content sanity (roles.yaml path to runtime ARC, arc.base.yaml has no project_id/scope, settings denies .env and secrets)
- Schema JSON validity

Write:
- reports/selftest/healthcheck.json
- reports/selftest/healthcheck.md

If AUTO_REPAIR==on, propose minimal templates and ASK before writing. Print concise PASS/FAIL summary.
