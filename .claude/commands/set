Apply ALPHA standards.
If PROJECT_ID or SCOPE is missing, ask and stop.
Compute project_slug; write codexcore/runtime/arc.yaml from codexcore/contracts/arc.base.yaml injecting:
  project_id: "<PROJECT_ID>"
  scope: "<SCOPE>"
Respond with a short summary of the resolved ARC and the project_slug. Do not run other agents.
