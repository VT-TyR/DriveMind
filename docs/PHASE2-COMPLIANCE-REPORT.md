## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - 2 critical and 3 high vulnerabilities
   - Must be resolved before production
   - Estimated fix time: 1 hour

2. **Test Coverage Gap**
   - 10% below ALPHA compliance threshold
   - Context and component coverage critically low
   - Estimated fix time: 2-3 hours

### Medium Risks
1. **Failing Tests**
   - 21 tests still failing
   - Mostly UI component tests
   - Estimated fix time: 1-2 hours

2. **Integration Test Coverage**
   - 20% below target
   - Database operations need more coverage
   - Estimated fix time: 2 hours

### Low Risks
1. **Documentation gaps**
2. **Performance optimization opportunities**
3. **Additional monitoring implementation**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Block Production)
1. **Fix Security Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix --force
   npm update
   ```

2. **Achieve 70% Test Coverage**
   - Focus on contexts (currently 7.48%)
   - Add component tests (currently ~45%)
   - Test file-api.ts (currently 0%)

3. **Fix Remaining Test Failures**
   - Prioritize component tests
   - Update test expectations
   - Mock external dependencies properly

### Pre-Staging Actions
1. **Execute E2E Tests**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Load testing with k6 or similar
   - Lighthouse CI integration
   - Bundle size analysis

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Dependency updates
   - SAST scan with semgrep
   - DAST scan with OWASP ZAP

## Staging Deployment Readiness

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities resolved
- [ ] Test coverage ≥70%
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] E2E tests executed successfully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scans passed

### Staging Configuration
```yaml
# apphosting.staging.yaml (already exists)
service: studio-staging

  - ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING: true
```

### Deployment Command
```bash

## Phase 2 Completion Status

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Phase 1 checkpoint created
- ✅ Critical test fixes applied (3 of 4)
- ✅ Integration tests created
- ✅ E2E tests created
- ✅ Security audit performed
- ✅ Compliance report generated

### Pending Tasks
- ❌ Achieve 70% test coverage
- ❌ Fix all failing tests (21 remaining)
- ❌ Resolve security vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ Staging deployment preparation (partial)

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has made significant progress with test improvements and comprehensive test suite expansion. However, the system is **NOT YET READY** for production deployment due to:

1. Critical security vulnerabilities (2)
2. Test coverage below compliance threshold (60% vs 70% required)
3. 21 failing tests requiring resolution

**Estimated Time to Production Ready**: 4-6 hours of focused remediation

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Emergency fix for security vulnerabilities (1 hour)
2. Test coverage improvement sprint (2-3 hours)
3. Fix remaining test failures (1-2 hours)
4. Final validation and staging deployment (1 hour)

**Phase 2 Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Production Ready**: NO
**Compliance Status**: NON-COMPLIANT (security + coverage)
**Action Required**: Critical remediation before proceeding
