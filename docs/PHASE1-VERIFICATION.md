## Known Issues

### Test Suite Issues (20 failures)
1. **scan-runner.test.ts**
   - Issue: Duplicate `PROJECT_ID` declaration (lines 4 and 26)
   - Impact: Test suite fails to run
   - Fix: Remove duplicate declaration

2. **error-boundary.test.tsx**
   - Issue: Unhandled exception in test
   - Impact: Error boundary tests failing
   - Fix: Add proper error suppression for expected errors

3. **logger.test.ts**
   - Issue: `mockLogger` accessed before initialization
   - Impact: Logger tests fail to run
   - Fix: Restructure mock initialization

4. **ScanManager.test.tsx**
   - Issue: Text content not found in rendered output
   - Impact: Component tests failing
   - Fix: Update test expectations

### Coverage Gaps
- Current: ~57% overall coverage
- Target: 70% for ALPHA-CODENAME compliance
- Gap: 13% additional coverage needed
- Critical uncovered areas:
  - File operations context (5.92%)
  - Auth context (14.28%)
  - File API (0%)
  - Toast hook (17.54%)

## Metrics Summary

### Performance
- Build time: ~4 minutes
- Test execution: ~4.7 seconds
- Deployment time: 3-5 minutes (auto)

### Quality Gates
- ❌ Test Coverage: 57% (target: 70%)
- ❌ Test Pass Rate: 84% (target: 100%)
- ✅ TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint: No production warnings
- ✅ Build: Successful

### Security
- ✅ OAuth secrets properly stored
- ✅ Firebase security rules configured
- ✅ HTTPS/SSL enabled
- ⚠️ SAST/DAST scans pending
- ⚠️ Dependency audit pending

## Phase 2 Requirements

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix 20 failing tests
2. Increase coverage to 70%
3. Add integration tests
4. Add E2E tests
5. Security validation

### Compliance Gates
- ALPHA-CODENAME v1.8 requirements:
  - ✅ Production-first mentality
  - ✅ Security as foundation
  - ❌ Test coverage ≥70%
  - ❌ Integration tests ≥60%
  - ❌ E2E tests present
  - ✅ Monitoring endpoints (/health, /metrics)
  - ✅ Structured logging

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Test coverage below compliance threshold
- No integration/E2E tests
- Security scans not performed

### Medium Risk
- 20 failing unit tests
- Background scan deployment pending

### Low Risk
- Documentation gaps
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Rollback Plan
- Git commit history preserved
- Previous working version: 3c980bc
- Rollback command: `git revert HEAD && git push`
- Recovery time: <5 minutes

## Approval Gates for Phase 2
- [ ] All unit tests passing (130/130)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥70%
- [ ] Integration tests implemented
- [ ] E2E tests implemented
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
