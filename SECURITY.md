## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Auth** with Google OAuth 2.0
- **Scoped Permissions** for Google Drive API access
- **JWT Token Management** with automatic refresh
- **Session Security** with secure cookie handling

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation** on all API endpoints using Zod schemas
- **Output Encoding** to prevent XSS attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention** through Firebase Firestore
- **CSRF Protection** via Next.js built-in protections

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Only** - all connections encrypted
- **Environment Variables** for secrets management
- **Firebase Security Rules** for database access
- **Content Security Policy** headers

### Production Gates (ALPHA Standards)
- **Automated Security Audits** via npm audit
- **Dependency Scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Static Code Analysis** via ESLint security plugins
- **Container Scanning** for deployment images

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: scott.presley@gmail.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Based on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix deployment

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Remote code execution, data breach
- **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation
- **Medium**: Limited data exposure, DoS attacks
- **Low**: Information disclosure, minor issues

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Requirements
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Follow principle of least privilege for API access
- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control

### Testing Requirements
- Include security test cases for new features
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Test rate limiting and DoS protection

### Deployment Security
- All secrets managed via Firebase secrets or environment variables
- Production builds must pass security audit gates
- Regular dependency updates for security patches
- Monitoring and alerting for security events

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
- **Firebase Security Rules** audit logs
- **API Rate Limiting** monitoring
- **Authentication Failure** tracking
- **Unusual Access Pattern** detection

### Manual Reviews
- **Quarterly Security Audits**
- **Dependency Vulnerability Reviews**
- **Access Control Reviews**
- **Security Configuration Reviews**

## Compliance

This project follows security standards aligned with:
- **OWASP Top 10** security risks
