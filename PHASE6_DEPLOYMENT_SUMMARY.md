## Deployment Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
1. Safety infrastructure implementation
2. Migration components development
3. Real-time adapters configuration
4. Admin dashboard creation
5. Build issues resolution
6. Firebase rules deployment
7. Documentation preparation

### ðŸ”„ Pending Actions (Manual Required)

#### 1. Git Push to Main Branch
```bash
# From a machine with GitHub access:
git push origin staging:main
```

#### 2. Verify App Hosting Deployment
```bash
# Check deployment status
curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/health
```

#### 3. Execute Migration
```bash
# Run migration trigger
npx tsx scripts/trigger-phase6-migration.ts
```

## Migration Execution Plan

### Phase Schedule
| Phase | Traffic | Duration | Validation Focus |
|-------|---------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | 5% | 5 min | Basic flow, rollback test |
| 2 | 25% | 10 min | Stability, performance |
| 3 | 50% | 15 min | Load handling, consistency |
| 4 | 75% | 10 min | Near-production validation |
| 5 | 100% | âˆž | Full migration complete |

### Monitoring URLs
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/admin/migration`
- **Safety Dashboard**: `/safety-dashboard`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Migration Status**: `/api/migration/phase6`

### Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5%
- P95 latency > 2000ms
- Validation failures
- Manual intervention via dashboard

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- âœ… Error rate < 1%
- âœ… P95 response time < 500ms
- âœ… Zero data loss
- âœ… Seamless user experience
- âœ… All validation checks passing

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data inconsistency | High | Validation at each phase |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Performance monitoring, auto-rollback |
| User disruption | Low | Phased rollout, instant rollback |
| System overload | Medium | Circuit breakers, load limiting |

curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/health

# Execute migration
npx tsx scripts/trigger-phase6-migration.ts
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check migration status
curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/migration/phase6

# View safety metrics
curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/safety/dashboard
```

## Conclusion

The Phase 6 migration infrastructure represents a **production-ready, safety-first approach** to transitioning from mock to real data. With comprehensive rollback capabilities, phased deployment, and real-time monitoring, the system is designed to ensure **zero downtime and zero data loss**.

### Next Immediate Step
