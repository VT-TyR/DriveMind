## Deployment Architecture

### Environment Topology
```
Production (main branch)
├── Firebase App Hosting
├── Firestore Database
├── Firebase Auth
└── Google OAuth 2.0

Staging (staging branch - to be created)
├── Same infrastructure
├── Feature flags enabled
└── Enhanced monitoring
```

### Security Configuration
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with JWT
- **Authorization**: Firestore security rules
- **Secrets Management**: Firebase Secrets Manager
- **API Security**: Token validation on all endpoints
- **Data Isolation**: User-scoped by UID

---

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Uncommitted Changes**: 39 modified files not in version control
   - **Mitigation**: Review and commit before deployment
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Could cause deployment failures

2. **Background Scan 500 Errors**: Known issue from Phase 2
   - **Mitigation**: Firebase Admin migration ready
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM - Core feature blocked

3. **No Staging Environment**: Currently deploying directly to production
   - **Mitigation**: Create staging branch and environment
   - **Impact**: HIGH - No safe testing environment

4. **Limited Test Coverage**: Test infrastructure incomplete
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive test suite
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM - Quality assurance gaps

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Checkpoint System
1. **Pre-deployment Snapshot**
   - Database backup via Firestore export
   - Configuration backup
   - Code version tagging

2. **Deployment Verification**
   - Health check endpoints
   - Smoke test suite
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Rollback Triggers**
   - Error rate >5%
   - P95 latency >500ms
   - Health check failures
   - Critical security alerts

4. **Recovery Procedure**
   ```bash
   # Immediate rollback
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   
   # Database rollback (if needed)
   gcloud firestore import gs://backup-bucket/[TIMESTAMP]
   
   # Verify recovery
   curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/health
   ```

---

## Monitoring Configuration

### Health Endpoints
- `/api/health` - System health check
- `/api/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `/api/about` - Version and compliance info

### Key Metrics
- **Availability**: Target >99.9%
- **Latency**: P95 <250ms, P99 <1s
- **Error Rate**: Target <1%
- **Throughput**: Monitor RPS capacity

### Alerting Rules
- Health check failures
- Error rate spikes
- Latency degradation
- Security violations

---

## Compliance Validation

### ALPHA-CODENAME v1.8 Gates
- [ ] Production-first mentality: No TODOs in production code
- [ ] Security foundation: RBAC, audit logs, secret rotation
- [ ] Parallelized execution: Task DAG optimization
- [ ] Insight-driven: Structured logging, metrics

### AEI21 Governance
- [ ] Privacy compliance: GDPR/CCPA alignment
- [ ] Audit trails: Immutable logging
- [ ] Disaster recovery: Tested rollback procedures
- [ ] Operational excellence: Documented runbooks
