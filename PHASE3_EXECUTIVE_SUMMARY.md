## Next Steps for Production Go-Live

### Immediate Actions (Before Deployment)

1. **Configure Git SSH Authentication**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "scott.presley@gmail.com"
# Add public key to GitHub account settings
```

2. **Execute Production Deployment**
```bash
git checkout main
bash scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

3. **Validate Production Health**
```bash
curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/health
```

### Post-Deployment Actions (0-7 Days)

1. Monitor performance metrics closely
2. Gather initial user feedback
3. Address any critical issues immediately
4. Complete staging environment validation
5. Configure production alerts

### Optimization Phase (7-30 Days)

1. Optimize P99 latency to <1000ms
2. Increase test coverage to 95%
3. Implement caching strategies
4. Enhance monitoring dashboards
5. Conduct security audit
