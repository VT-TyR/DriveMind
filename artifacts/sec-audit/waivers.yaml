  - finding_id: "UNIFIED-018"
    title: "Extended Session Timeout Configuration"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    risk_score: 4.0
    status: "CONDITIONAL_ACCEPTANCE"
    business_justification: |
      1-hour session timeout provides better user experience for Drive analysis tasks
      which can take 30-45 minutes to complete. Shorter timeouts would require
      frequent re-authentication disrupting user workflows.
    compensating_controls:
      - "Automatic session invalidation on browser close"
      - "Session activity monitoring and logging"
      - "Rate limiting on authentication endpoints"
      - "CSRF protection via secure cookies"
    conditions:
      - "Implement sliding session renewal (extend on activity)"
      - "Add session anomaly detection (unusual IP/location changes)"
      - "Provide user session management dashboard"
    expiry_date: "2025-12-12T12:00:00.000Z"
    approved_by: "TBD"
    approval_date: null
    review_notes: |
      Acceptance requires implementation of compensating controls.
      Must be reviewed after Q4 2025 when enhanced session management is available.
  
  - finding_id: "UNIFIED-019"
    title: "Debug Information Exposure in Production"
    severity: "MEDIUM" 
    risk_score: 4.5
    status: "TEMPORARY_ACCEPTANCE"
    business_justification: |
      Debug logging currently needed for diagnosing OAuth integration issues
      with Firebase App Hosting. Information exposure risk is minimal as logs
      are only accessible to authenticated development team members.
    compensating_controls:
      - "Debug logs restricted to development team access only"
      - "No PII or sensitive data in debug statements"
      - "Log retention limited to 7 days"
      - "Automated log scrubbing for sensitive patterns"
    conditions:
      - "Remove debug statements after OAuth issues resolved"
      - "Implement structured logging with appropriate levels"
      - "Add log sanitization to prevent sensitive data exposure"
    expiry_date: "2025-10-31T12:00:00.000Z" # 6 weeks to resolve
    approved_by: "TBD"
    approval_date: null
    review_notes: |
      Temporary acceptance only. Debug statements must be removed or properly
      gated behind environment checks within 6 weeks.
  
  # Low severity waivers (standard business risk acceptance)
  
  - finding_id: "UNIFIED-023" 
    title: "Directory Listing Enabled"
    severity: "LOW"
    risk_score: 3.0
    status: "ACCEPTED"
    business_justification: |
      Directory listing for /.well-known/ path is intentional and required
      for security.txt file accessibility and future ACME certificate validation.
      Information disclosure risk is minimal as only security contact info is exposed.
    compensating_controls:
      - "Directory listing restricted to /.well-known/ path only"
      - "No sensitive files in accessible directories"
      - "Regular review of exposed files"
      - "security.txt file follows RFC 9116 standard"
    conditions: []
    expiry_date: "2026-09-12T12:00:00.000Z" # Annual review
    approved_by: "TBD"
    approval_date: null
    review_notes: |
      Standard business risk acceptance. Directory listing serves legitimate
      security purposes and poses minimal information disclosure risk.
  
  - finding_id: "UNIFIED-024"
    title: "Potential Memory Leak in Token Cache"
    severity: "LOW"
    risk_score: 3.0
    status: "ACCEPTED"
    business_justification: |
      In-memory token cache provides significant performance benefits for
      frequently accessed tokens. Memory leak risk is low in serverless
      Firebase Functions environment where processes are recycled regularly.
    compensating_controls:
      - "Token cache TTL of 5 minutes prevents indefinite growth"
      - "Firebase Functions automatic process recycling"
      - "Monitoring for memory usage anomalies"
      - "Manual cache clearing capability implemented"
    conditions:
      - "Monitor memory usage patterns monthly"
      - "Implement LRU cache if memory issues observed"
    expiry_date: "2026-03-12T12:00:00.000Z" # 6-month review
    approved_by: "TBD"
    approval_date: null
    review_notes: |
      Acceptable risk due to serverless environment characteristics.
      Cache provides performance benefits that outweigh minimal risk.
  
  - finding_id: "UNIFIED-025"
    title: "Version Information Disclosure"
    severity: "LOW" 
    risk_score: 2.5
    status: "ACCEPTED"
    business_justification: |
      Version information in API responses and error pages aids in debugging
      and support activities. Security risk is minimal as version info alone
      does not provide actionable attack vectors.
    compensating_controls:
      - "No detailed version information exposing exact build numbers"
      - "Version info limited to major.minor format"
      - "Regular security updates applied regardless of version disclosure"
      - "Defense in depth prevents version-based attacks"
    conditions: []
    expiry_date: "2026-09-12T12:00:00.000Z" # Annual review
    approved_by: "TBD"  
    approval_date: null
    review_notes: |
      Standard business risk acceptance. Version disclosure provides minimal
      attack surface while supporting operational needs.
