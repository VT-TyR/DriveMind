      PRODUCTION EMERGENCY: Background scans start successfully but never complete.
      Users see infinite "scanning..." state with no results or error feedback.
      Investigation shows scan jobs created in Firestore but processor fails silently.
    rootCause:
      - Background scan processor in `processBackgroundScan` function failing
      - Possible Google Drive API rate limiting or timeout issues
      - Error handling not providing feedback to users
      - Scan completion logic may have bugs preventing job finalization
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - Background scans complete successfully for typical Drive accounts (< 1000 files)
      - Scan progress updates properly show completion percentage
      - Scan results are persisted and displayed to users
      - Error cases provide clear feedback and recovery options
      - Failed scans can be retried by users
    definition_of_done:
      - Test scan completes on production with real Google Drive account
      - Scan results visible in dashboard and inventory
      - Error logging provides actionable debugging information
      - Performance acceptable for drives with 1000+ files

        - "src/lib/google-drive.ts (rate limiting and error handling)"
        - "src/components/dashboard/scan-progress.tsx (error display)"
      investigation:
        - Check Cloud Function logs for scan processor errors
        - Verify Google Drive API rate limits and quotas
        - Test scan completion logic with small file sets
        - Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring

      PRODUCTION EMERGENCY: File inventory page shows sample/mock data instead of user's actual Drive files.
      Users cannot see, manage, or interact with their real files - core value proposition is broken.
      `listSampleFiles` AI flow returns limited sample data instead of real enumeration.
    rootCause:
      - Inventory page uses `listSampleFiles` AI flow which returns mock data
      - Real Google Drive enumeration not implemented or broken
      - File operations disabled (in `api-disabled` folder)
      - Missing proper Drive API integration for file listing

      APIs are in `api-disabled` folder, making file management impossible.
      Users have no way to act on file insights or manage their Drive.
    rootCause:
      - All file operation APIs moved to `src/app/api-disabled/` folder
      - File action buttons likely have no working handlers
      - Missing proper error handling and validation for file operations
      - Potential OAuth scope or permission issues
    acceptanceCriteria:

      - Token storage to Firestore may be failing
      - Token refresh logic in `src/lib/google-auth.ts` may have issues
      - Cookie-based token storage may have expiration problems
      - Missing proper error handling for token refresh failures
