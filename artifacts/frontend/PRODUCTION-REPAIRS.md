## Critical Production Issues Fixed

### 🔧 File Operations Restored
**Issue**: All file actions (rename, move, delete) were failing silently  
**Solution**: Created complete API endpoint infrastructure
- ✅ `/api/files/move` - Move files between folders
- ✅ `/api/files/delete` - Soft delete (trash) files  
- ✅ `/api/files/rename` - Rename files with validation
- ✅ `/api/files/restore` - Restore from trash
- ✅ `/api/folders/create` - Create new folders

**Technical Details**:
- Google Drive API integration with OAuth tokens
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation and sanitization

### 🔄 Real-Time Updates Fixed
**Issue**: Scan progress stuck in loading state, SSE connections failing  
**Solution**: Enhanced SSE hook with robust error handling
- ✅ Connection validation before establishing SSE
- ✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Proper cleanup and timeout handling
- ✅ Heartbeat mechanism for connection health

### 🔐 Authentication State Management
**Issue**: Token refresh failures causing UI to freeze  
**Solution**: Improved auth hook with error recovery
- ✅ Token refresh functionality with error states
- ✅ Proper loading state management
- ✅ Authentication error recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Context import conflicts resolved

### ⏱️ Loading States & UX
**Issue**: Indefinite loading with no timeout or recovery  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive loading system
- ✅ `LoadingState` component with timeout handling
- ✅ Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Progressive loading with proper fallbacks

### 📁 Real Data Integration  
**Issue**: File inventory showing mock data instead of real Drive files  
**Solution**: Integrated with scan results and fallback logic
- ✅ Dashboard stats API integration for real data
- ✅ Smart fallback to sample data when needed
- ✅ Proper empty states and user guidance
- ✅ Enhanced loading and error states
