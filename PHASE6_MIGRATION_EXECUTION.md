### Current Infrastructure

#### Migration Components
1. **Migration API**: `/api/migration/phase6`
   - Phased rollout support (5% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100%)
   - Rollback capabilities at any phase
   - Data validation at each transition

2. **Admin Dashboard**: `/admin/migration`
   - Real-time migration progress monitoring
   - Phase transition controls
   - Rollback triggers
   - Validation status display

3. **Safety Infrastructure**:
   - `/src/lib/safety/` - Complete safety framework
   - Rollback manager for instant recovery
   - Validation framework for data integrity
   - Performance monitoring for migration health

4. **Real-time Adapters**:
   - Dashboard metrics adapter
   - Scan results adapter
   - Analytics adapter
   - All configured for seamless mock â†’ real transition

### Deployment Instructions

#### Step 1: Deploy to App Hosting
Since we cannot push directly to GitHub, the deployment needs to be triggered manually:

1. **Manual Git Push** (from authorized machine):
   ```bash
   git push origin staging:main
   ```

2. **Alternative: Firebase CLI Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Already completed:
   npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
   
   # App Hosting will auto-deploy on git push
   ```

#### Step 2: Verify Deployment
Once deployed, verify the following endpoints:

1. **Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/health
   ```

2. **Migration Status**:
   ```bash
   curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/migration/phase6
   ```

3. **Safety Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   curl https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/api/safety/dashboard
   ```

#### Step 3: Execute Migration

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**:
   - URL: `https://studio--drivemind-q69b7.us-central1.hosted.app/admin/migration`
   - Monitor real-time progress

2. **Run Migration Trigger Script**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/trigger-phase6-migration.ts
   ```

3. **Monitor Each Phase**:
   - Phase 1: 5% traffic (validation phase)
   - Phase 2: 25% traffic (stability check)
   - Phase 3: 50% traffic (performance validation)
   - Phase 4: 75% traffic (final validation)
   - Phase 5: 100% traffic (full migration)

### Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Initial Validation (5%)
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Validates basic data flow
- Checks error rates
- Confirms rollback capability

#### Phase 2: Stability Check (25%)
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Monitors performance metrics
- Validates data consistency
- Tests load handling

#### Phase 3: Performance Validation (50%)
- Duration: 15 minutes
- Full performance analysis
- Load testing validation
- Error rate monitoring

#### Phase 4: Final Validation (75%)
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Near-production load testing
- Final safety checks
- Rollback readiness verification

#### Phase 5: Full Migration (100%)
- Duration: Continuous
- Complete transition to real data
- Mock data fully deprecated
- Continuous monitoring active

### Monitoring During Migration

1. **Real-time Dashboard**:
   - URL: `/admin/migration`
   - Shows current phase, progress, validation status
   - Provides rollback controls

2. **Safety Dashboard**:
   - URL: `/safety-dashboard`
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rates
   - System health

3. **Logs**:
   - Firebase Console logs
   - Browser console for client-side monitoring
   - Server logs for API health

### Rollback Procedures

If issues occur at any phase:

1. **Automatic Rollback** (triggered by):
   - Error rate > 5%
   - Response time > 2000ms P95
   - Validation failures

2. **Manual Rollback**:
   - Via Admin Dashboard "Rollback" button
   - Via API: `POST /api/migration/phase6` with `{"action": "rollback"}`

3. **Post-Rollback**:
   - System reverts to mock data
   - All real-time connections preserved
   - No data loss
   - Investigation begins

### Success Criteria

Migration is considered successful when:
- âœ… All phases complete without rollback
- âœ… Error rate < 1% sustained for 30 minutes
- âœ… P95 response time < 500ms
- âœ… All validation checks pass
- âœ… No data inconsistencies detected
- âœ… User experience remains seamless

### Post-Migration Tasks

After successful migration:
1. Remove mock data generation code
2. Update monitoring thresholds
3. Document performance baselines
4. Archive migration infrastructure
5. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## Current Status: AWAITING DEPLOYMENT

The migration infrastructure is fully implemented and tested. The next step is to:
1. Deploy to App Hosting (requires git push to main)
2. Execute the migration trigger script
3. Monitor the phased rollout

All safety systems are in place. The migration can proceed when ready.
