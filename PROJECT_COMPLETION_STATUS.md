## ⚠️ Pending Issues

### Critical Issue (Blocks Core Functionality)
**Background Scan 500 Errors**
- **Impact**: Users cannot run background scans (core feature)
- **Root Cause**: Remaining client-side Firebase calls in server context
- **Status**: ✅ **Fix Ready** - Changes staged in `firebase-db.ts`
- **Resolution**: Deploy staged Firebase Admin fixes
- **ETA**: 5 minutes (just deployment time)

```bash
# IMMEDIATE FIX
git add src/lib/firebase-db.ts
git commit -m "Complete Firebase Admin migration for background scans"
git push origin main
# Wait 3-5 minutes for automatic deployment
```
