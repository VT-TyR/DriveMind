# Development Status and Known Issues

This document provides an up-to-date summary of the DriveMind project's development status, including recent activities, known issues, and implemented fixes. It serves as a living document for developers to quickly understand the project's current state.

## Current Development Status

The project is actively under development, with core functionalities for Google Drive scanning and basic file operations being implemented and refined. The backend Firebase Functions are being developed to handle scalable data processing, while the frontend is focusing on user experience and data visualization.

## Recent Development Activities

-   **ScanRunner Module Refinement:** Significant work has been done on the `ScanRunner` module in `functions/src/scan-runner.ts` to improve its testability and reliability. This involved refactoring the constructor to allow dependency injection of the Google Drive API client.
-   **Checkpoint Management Enhancement:** The `CheckpointManager` in `functions/src/checkpoint-manager.ts` has been updated to ensure more robust checkpointing and retrieval, particularly addressing issues with timestamp comparisons in tests.

## Known Issues

As of the last update, the following issues are known and are either being actively worked on or are pending resolution:

1.  **Frontend Component Test Failures:** Several frontend component tests are currently failing. These failures often manifest as:
    *   `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` in `src/__tests__/lib/export-service.test.ts`.
    *   `TypeError: Cannot redefine property: location` in `src/__tests__/components/error-boundary.test.tsx`.
    *   `Element type is invalid` or `Warning: An update to ScanManager inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)` in `src/__tests__/components/scans/ScanManager.test.tsx`.
    *   `Unable to find an element with the text` in `src/__tests__/components/shared/file-actions.test.tsx`.
    *   `expect(received).toBe(expected)` with `Received: undefined` in `src/__tests__/hooks/use-performance.test.ts`.
    *   `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'mockLogger' before initialization` in `src/__tests__/lib/logger.test.ts`.
    These typically indicate issues with React component rendering, asynchronous state updates not being properly awaited, or incorrect mocking of browser APIs or external modules.

2.  **Backend Test Flakiness (`checkpoint-manager.test.ts`):** Although recent fixes have been applied, the `checkpoint-manager.test.ts` has shown flakiness related to timestamp comparisons and mock object state persistence between tests. Further investigation may be required if issues persist.

3.  **`SyntaxError: Identifier 'PROJECT_ID' has already been declared`:** This error has been observed in `functions/src/__tests__/scan-runner.test.ts` and suggests a potential issue with how test files are loaded or how global constants are defined across test suites. This needs to be investigated to prevent variable re-declaration.

## Implemented Fixes (Since Last Major Update)

-   **`scan-runner.test.ts` Mocking Improvement:**
    *   **Issue:** `ScanRunner` was creating a new `google.drive` mock instance in its constructor, separate from the one mocked globally in the test file, leading to `mockResolvedValueOnce` being applied to the wrong instance.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `jest.mock('googleapis')` to return a single, persistent `mockDrive` object. The `ScanRunner` constructor was updated to accept an optional `driveInstance` for dependency injection, ensuring the test uses the correctly mocked `drive` instance. The `beforeEach` block now clears and resets `mockDrive.files.list` for each test.

-   **`checkpoint-manager.test.ts` Timestamp Consistency:**
    *   **Issue:** Tests were failing due to `Date.now()` returning varying timestamps, causing mismatches in `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, and `updatedAt` fields when comparing checkpoint objects.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented `jest.spyOn(Date, 'now').mockReturnValue(fixedTimestamp)` in `beforeEach` to ensure a consistent timestamp across test runs. The `mockDoc` setup was moved into `beforeEach` to ensure fresh mocks for each test, preventing state leakage between tests. `jest.restoreAllMocks()` is used in `afterEach` to clean up mocks.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps involve addressing the remaining failing frontend tests. Each failing test suite will be analyzed individually to identify the root cause and implement appropriate fixes, focusing on proper React testing practices, asynchronous operation handling, and correct mocking strategies.
