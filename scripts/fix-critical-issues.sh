- ✅ Fixed server/client component boundaries

### 2. Test Infrastructure  
- ✅ Fixed usePerformance test mock implementation
- ✅ Fixed export-service async/sync method signatures
- ⚠️ Coverage below 70% threshold (requires additional test coverage)

### 3. Authentication Flow
- ✅ OAuth endpoints validated and secured with rate limiting
- ✅ CSRF token validation implemented
- ✅ Security middleware applied

### 4. Deployment Readiness
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ⚠️ Test coverage needs improvement

## Next Steps
