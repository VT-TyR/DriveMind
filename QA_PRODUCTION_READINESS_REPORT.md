## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Network Simulation Test Skipped** - CI environment limitation, not production impact
2. **Long-running E2E Test Skipped** - 15+ minute test excluded from CI, covered in manual testing
3. **File Upload Test Skipped** - Feature not yet implemented

### Technical Debt Items
1. **High Complexity Functions** - 2 functions exceed complexity threshold (refactoring recommended)
2. **Slow E2E Tests** - Some tests exceed 45 seconds (optimization planned)
3. **External Service Coverage** - Could increase from 75% to 80% (enhancement)

### Performance Considerations
1. **Large Dataset Rendering** - 10,000+ files may impact initial load time
2. **Memory Usage** - Extended sessions may gradually increase memory usage
3. **SSE Connections** - Long-running connections may need periodic refresh
